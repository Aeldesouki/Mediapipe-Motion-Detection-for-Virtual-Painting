This is a personal project made using the mediapipe library to simulate motion detection in python. The main application of this program is to detect hand and finger gestures through a webcam, which will then be
interpreted and used to paint on a virtual canvas. 

How to use:

To enter drawing mode, simply hold your index finger out and move it around to start drawing on the canvas. To enter selection mode, hold both the index and middle finger out, and hover over any of the color selections
at the top to choose that specific color, which can then be used when entering drawing mode again.

Note:

- A webcam is needed for this program, as without one, it is impossible to detect the hand gestures needed for this program to work. Better quality webcams will yield in better results. This program also has to be used
  in a fairly well lit room in order to work effectively.

- The PaintImages folder is needed, as it provides the headers that serve as a visual, showing where color and eraser selections are in order to be used to paint on the canvas. The header will appear in the top when the
  program runes
